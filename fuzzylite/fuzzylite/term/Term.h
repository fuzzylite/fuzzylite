      The Term class is the abstract class for linguistic terms. The linguistic
      terms in this library can be divided in four groups as: `basic`,
      `extended`, `edge`, and `function`. The `basic` terms are Triangle,
      Trapezoid, Rectangle, and Discrete. The `extended` terms are Bell,
      Binary, Cosine, Gaussian, GaussianProduct, PiShape, SigmoidDifference,
      SigmoidProduct, and Spike. The `edge` terms are Concave, Ramp, Sigmoid,
      SShape, and ZShape. The `function` terms are Constant, Linear, and
      Function.

      In the figure below, the `basic` terms are represented in the first
      column, and the `extended` terms in the second and third columns. The
      `edge` terms are represented in the fifth and sixth rows, and the
      `function` terms in the last row.
