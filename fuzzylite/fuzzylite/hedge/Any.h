      The Any class is a special Hedge that always returns `1.0`. Its
      position with respect to the other hedges is last in the ordered set
      (Not, Seldom, Somewhat, Very, Extremely, Any). The Antecedent of a Rule
      considers Any to be a syntactically special hedge because it is not
      followed by a Term (e.g., `if Variable is any then...`). Amongst hedges,
      only Any has virtual methods to be overriden due to its particular case.
