      The Activation class is the abstract class for RuleBlock activation
      methods. An activation method implements the criteria to activate the
      rules within a given rule block. An activation method needs to process
      every rule and determine whether the rule is to be activated or
      deactivated. The activation methods were first introduced in version 6.0,
      but in earlier versions the term `activation` referred to the TNorm that
      modulated the consequent of a rule, which is now referred to as the
      `implication` operator.
