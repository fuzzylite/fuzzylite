    /**
      The Rule class is a conditional statement that contributes to the control
      of an Engine. Each rule consists of an Antecedent and a Consequent, each
      of which comprises propositions in the form `variable is term`. The
      propositions in the Antecedent can be connected by the conjunctive `and`
      or the disjunctive `or`, both of which are fuzzy logic operators (TNorm
      and SNorm, respectively). Differently, the propositions in the Consequent
      are independent from each other and are separated with a symbolic `and`.
      The Term in any proposition can be preceded by a Hedge that modifies its
      membership function to model cases such as Very, Somewhat, Seldom and
      Not. Additionally, the contribution of a rule to the control of the
      engine can be determined by its weight @f$w \in [0.0, 1.0]@f$, which is
      equal to 1.0 if omitted. The structure of a rule is the following: `if
      (antecedent) then (consequent) [with weight]`. The structures of
      the antecedent and the consequent are:

     `if variable is [hedge]* term [(and|or) variable is [hedge]* term]*`

     `then variable is [hedge]* term [and variable is [hedge]* term]* [with w]?`

      where elements in brackets are optional, elements in parentheses are
      compulsory, `*`-marked elements may appear zero or more times, and
     `?`-marked elements may appear once or not at all.
