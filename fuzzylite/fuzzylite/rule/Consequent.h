      The Consequent class is a proposition set that represents and evaluates
      the consequent of a Rule.. The structure of a rule is: `if (antecedent)

      `then variable is [hedge]* term [and variable is [hedge]* term]* [with
      w]?`

      where `*`-marked elements may appear zero or more times, elements in
      brackets are optional, elements in parentheses are compulsory, and
      `?`-marked elements may appear once or not at all.
