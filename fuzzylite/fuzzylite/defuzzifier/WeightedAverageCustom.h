      The (experimental) WeightedAverageCustom class is a WeightedDefuzzifier that computes the
      weighted average of a fuzzy set represented in an Aggregated Term utilizing
      the fuzzy operators for implication and aggregation to compute the weighted
      average.  This is an experimental approach to take advantage of customization
      thanks to the object-oriented design.
