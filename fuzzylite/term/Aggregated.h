      The Aggregated class is a special Term that stores a fuzzy set with the
      Activated terms from the Antecedent%s of a Rule, thereby serving mainly
      as the fuzzy output value of the OutputVariable%s. The ownership of the
      activated terms will be transfered to objects of this class, and
      therefore their destructors will be called upon destruction of this term
      (or calling Aggregated::clear()).
