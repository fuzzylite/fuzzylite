### <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>


`fuzzylite` is a free and open-source fuzzy logic control library programmed in C++ for multiple platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS). [`jfuzzylite`](https://github.com/fuzzylite/jfuzzylite/) is the equivalent library for Java and Android platforms. Together, they are **The FuzzyLite Libraries for Fuzzy Logic Control**.

 The **goal** of the FuzzyLite Libraries is to **easily** design and **efficiently** operate fuzzy logic controllers following an **object-oriented** programming model **without** relying on external libraries.

### <a name="compile-build-execute">Compile, Link, and Execute</a>

Once you have an engine written in C++, you can compile it to create an executable file which links to the `fuzzylite` library. The linking can be either static or dynamic. Basically, the differences between static and dynamic linking are the following.  **Static linking** includes the `fuzzylite` library into your executable file, hence increasing its size, but the executable no longer needs to  have access to the `fuzzylite` library files. **Dynamic linking** does not include the `fuzzylite` library into your executable file, hence reducing its size, but the executable needs to have access to the `fuzzylite` shared library file. When using dynamic linking, make sure that  the shared library files are  either in the same directory as the executable, or are reachable via environmental variables:

```posh
rem Windows:
set PATH="\path\to\fuzzylite\release\bin;%PATH%"
```
```bash 
#Unix:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/fuzzylite/release/bin/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

#### Windows
The commands to compile your engine in Windows are the following:

C++11 (default)
```posh
rem static linking:
cl.exe ObstacleAvoidance.cpp fuzzylite-static.lib /Ipath/to/fuzzylite /EHsc /MD
```
```posh
rem dynamic linking:
cl.exe ObstacleAvoidance.cpp fuzzylite.lib /Ipath/to/fuzzylite /DFL_IMPORT_LIBRARY /EHsc /MD 
```

C++98
```posh
rem static linking:
cl.exe ObstacleAvoidance.cpp fuzzylite-static.lib /Ipath/to/fuzzylite /DFL_CPP98=ON /EHsc /MD
```
```posh
rem dynamic linking:
cl.exe ObstacleAvoidance.cpp fuzzylite.lib /Ipath/to/fuzzylite /DFL_IMPORT_LIBRARY /DFL_CPP98=ON /EHsc /MD 
```

#### Unix
The commands to compile your engine in Unix are the following:

C++11 (default)
```bash
#static linking
g++ ObstacleAvoidance.cpp -o ObstacleAvoidance -I/path/to/fuzzylite -L/path/to/fuzzylite/release/bin -lfuzzylite-static --std=c++11
```
```bash
#dynamic linking
g++ ObstacleAvoidance.cpp -o ObstacleAvoidance -I/path/to/fuzzylite -L/path/to/fuzzylite/release/bin -lfuzzylite -Wno-non-literal-null-conversion
```

C++98
```bash
#static linking
g++ ObstacleAvoidance.cpp -o ObstacleAvoidance -I/path/to/fuzzylite -L/path/to/fuzzylite/release/bin -lfuzzylite-static -DFL_CPP98=ON
```
```bash
#dynamic linking
g++ ObstacleAvoidance.cpp -o ObstacleAvoidance -I/path/to/fuzzylite -L/path/to/fuzzylite/release/bin -lfuzzylite -DFL_CPP98=ON -Wno-non-literal-null-conversion
```

#### CMake
Alternatively, you can use CMake to build your project linking to `fuzzylite`. Please, refer to the example application available at [examples/application]([/examples/application]).



***


### <a name="building">Building  from Source</a>
You can build the `fuzzylite` library from source using  `CMake` [(cmake.org)](https://cmake.org/).

The files [`fuzzylite/build.bat`](/fuzzylite/build.bat) and [`fuzzylite/build.sh`](/fuzzylite/build.sh) are build scripts for the Windows and Unix platforms, respectively.
After building from source, the resulting binaries will be located in the sub-folders `fuzzylite/release/bin` and `fuzzylite/debug/bin`. The usage of these scripts is presented as follows.

#### Windows
```bash
> build.bat help
Usage:  build.bat [options]
where   [options] can be any of the following:
    all          builds fuzzylite in debug and release mode (default)
    debug        builds fuzzylite in debug mode
    release      builds fuzzylite in release mode
    clean        erases previous builds
    help         shows this information
```

#### Unix
```bash
$ ./build.sh help
Usage:  [bash] ./build.sh [options]
where   [options] can be any of the following:
    all          builds fuzzylite in debug and release mode (default)
    debug        builds fuzzylite in debug mode
    release      builds fuzzylite in release mode
    clean        erases previous builds
    help         shows this information
```



#### Building Options
For advanced building options, please check the contents of [`fuzzylite/build.bat`](/fuzzylite/build.bat) or [`fuzzylite/build.sh`](/fuzzylite/build.sh), and the contents of [`fuzzylite/CMakeLists.txt`](/fuzzylite/CMakeLists.txt).

The following building options available:

* `-DFL_USE_FLOAT=ON` builds the binaries utilizing the `fl::scalar` data type as a `float` represented in 4 bytes. By default, the binaries are built utilizing `-DFL_USE_FLOAT=OFF` to utilize `fl::scalar` as a `double` represented in 8 bytes and hence providing better accuracy. If `fuzzylite` is built with `-DFL_USE_FLOAT=ON`, then the applications linking to `fuzzylite` also need to specify this compilation flag. 


* `-DFL_CPP98=ON` builds binaries utilizing `C++98` features. By default, `fuzzylite` is built with `-DFL_CPP98=OFF` to utilize `C++11` features. If compiling for `C++98`, be aware that you will not be able to benchmark the performance of your engine using the `Benchmark` class.


* `-DFL_BACKTRACE=OFF` disables the backtrace information in case of errors (default is ON). In Windows, the backtrace information requires the external library `dbghelp`, which is generally available in your system.

* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release]` sets the mode of your build. You can only build one mode at a time with a single CMake script.


#### Documentation
The source code of `fuzzylite` is very well documented using [`doxygen`](www.doxygen.org/) formatting, and the documentation is available at [fuzzylite.com/documentation](https://fuzzylite.com/documentation). If you want to generate the documentation locally, you can produce the `html` documentation from the file [Doxyfile](/Doxyfile) using the command line: `doxygen Doxyfile`. The documentation will be created in the [`documentation`](/documentation) folder.



***

### <a name="binaries">Binaries</a>

After building from source, the following are the relevant binaries that will be created in `Release` mode. In `Debug` mode, the file names end with `-debug` (e.g., `fuzzylite-debug.exe`).

#### Windows

- console application: `fuzzylite.exe`
- shared library: `fuzzylite.dll`, `fuzzylite.lib`
- static library: `fuzzylite-static.lib`

#### Linux

- console application: `fuzzylite`
- shared library: `libfuzzylite.so`
- static library: `libfuzzylite-static.a`

#### Mac

- console application: `fuzzylite`
- shared library: `libfuzzylite.dylib`
- static library: `libfuzzylite-static.a`


#### Console
The console application of `fuzzylite` allows you to import and export your engines. Its usage can be obtained executing the console binary. In addition, the console can be set in interactive mode. The `FuzzyLite Interactive Console`  allows you to evaluate a given controller by manually providing the input values. The interactive console is triggered by specifying an input file and an output format. For example, to interact with the `ObstacleAvoidance` controller, the interactive console is launched as follows:

```bash
fuzzylite -i ObstacleAvoidance.fll -of fld
```

***

### <a name="whatsnew">What's New?</a>
* The FuzzyLite Libraries, namely fuzzylite and jfuzzylite, both in version 6.0, are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

* By default, fuzzylite builds using C++11 instead of C++98. 

* Important performance improvements.

* Refactored the following names for the operation of engines: from activation operator to implication operator, from accumulation operator to aggregation operator.

* Renamed the term `Accumulated` to `Aggregated`.

* New activation methods decouple the activation of rules from the rule block and provide different methods for activating rules (see Activation Methods).

* New class `ActivationFactory` provides a factory of activation methods.

* New class `Benchmark` to evaluate the performance and accuracy of engines.

* New class `Complexity` to estimate the computational complexity of an engine.

* New class `RScriptExporter` to export the surfaces of an engine using the `ggplot2` library.

* New class `Binary` term for binary edges.

* New `UnboundedSum` S-Norm in `SNormFactory`.

* New classes `SNormFunction` and `TNormFunction` to create custom functions on any two values using the `Function` class.

* Added description strings to `Engine`, `Variable` and `RuleBlock`

* Privatized previously protected members of classes and subclasses of `Term`, `Variable`, `Rule`, `Defuzzifier`, `[Cloning|Construction]Factory`, `Importer`, `Exporter`, amongst others.

* Improved portability by replacing `int` for `std::size_t` where necessary, thereby additionally removing warnings in Windows 64bit

* Deleted `Operation.cpp` and inlined its methods into `Operation.h`

* Updated `.travis.yml` to use Docker, and build using g++ (versions 6, 5, 4.9, 4.8, 4.7) and clang (versions 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, and 3.5). 

* Added `appveyor.yml` to use continuous integration in Windows under Visual Studio 2013 and 2015.

* Added some unit tests and support for future unit tests.

* Bug fixes.

* New example of hybrid engines.

* New example on obstacle avoidance for Mamdani, Takagi-Sugeno, and Hybrid engines.

* New R scripts for each example and its respective surfaces in `pdf` formats.

#### Bug fixes
* Fixed bug in `CloningFactory::deregisterObject()`. Bug: Object was deleted before removing it from the map, leaving an invalid object in the map which would cause a segmentation fault. Solution: Remove the object from the map before deleting it.
* Fixed bug causing segmentation fault when malformed term in FuzzyLite Language
* Fixed bug computing the `NormalizedSum` S-Norm.
* Fixed bug in `RuleBlock` to reset and clone the implication operator. Bug: implication operator is not copied and reset. Fix: copy and reset implication operator when cloning the `RuleBlock`.
* Fixed bug in `Function` term. Bug: given a formula = "tan(y)" and a map["y"] = 1.0, and executing `Function::load(formula)`, then the map of variables is reset because `load()` calls `unload()` first, causing the deregistration of variable `y`. Solution: Removed method `unload()` from `load()`, thereby causing future `load()` not to reset variables.
* Fixed bug in `Function` when enclosing variable in double parenthesis.
